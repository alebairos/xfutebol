Things to do: 
- Algebraic notation.
- A form template to register the game setup and a form template to register ongoing data: Goals, number of fouls, number of yellow and red cards, number of Sprints, and maybe a couple of things I forgot.
- Simulate sequences of game play: A full fledge sequence of until a golden goal, specific situations to stress the limits of the rules.
- Design a CLI that will be the first form of playing the digital game. 
- Run the physical board version using paper version of the forms 
- Design the Engine. The architecture should not rely on servers for game play. Servers would fit better for Analytics.
