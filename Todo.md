Things to do: 
- [] Algebraic notation.
- [x] A form template to register the game setup and a form template to register ongoing data: Goals, number of fouls, number of yellow and red cards, number of Sprints, and maybe a couple of things I forgot.
- [x] Simulate sequences of game play: A full fledge sequence of until a golden goal, specific situations to stress the limits of the rules.
- [] Design a CLI that will be the first form of playing the digital game. 
- [x] Run the physical board version using paper version of the forms 
- [] Design the Engine. The architecture should not rely on servers for game play. Servers would fit better for Analytics. 
- [x] Include the checkers pieces for players. Use the pen to mark the shirt numbers.
- [x] LONG pass and LONG SHOOT for everypiece. But Long Experts shots are uninterceptable. Evaluate that.
- [x] Increase to 4 the numbers of squares that form the goal. This way, a tentative of a shoot will have a greater chance of succeding since a GK moves itself by one square per turn.
- [x] regra para evitar que as peças fiquem dentro do gol. Só o goleiro consegue parar a bola. Dentro do gol, a bola passa direto por outras peças.
- [x] no game setup, gk fica na 1, D na 2, M na 3 e A na 4.
