# 2. The Board

"xfutebol" is played on a board that skillfully merges the strategic layout of a chessboard with the thematic elements of a soccer field.

## Board Layout
- **Size and Grid**: The game utilizes an 8x8 grid, akin to a standard chessboard, with each square representing a segment of the soccer field.
- **Design**: The board features design elements of a soccer field, such as midfield lines and goal areas, within the functional framework of a chessboard.

## Special Areas
### Penalty Areas
- These are located at each end of the board, mirroring the penalty zones on a soccer field. The penalty areas extend from B1 to G1 and B2 to G2 for one player, and the symmetrically opposite rectangles for the other player.
- Specific rules apply when pieces and the ball are within these zones, echoing the critical nature of penalty areas in soccer.

### Goal Tiles
- Situated within the penalty areas, these tiles represent the goals. They consist of C1, D1, E1, F1 for one player, and their symmetric counterparts for the opposing player.
- Scoring is achieved by moving the ball into these tiles under designated gameplay conditions.

### Midfield Line
- This line bisects the board, dividing it into two halves, setting the starting territories for each player.

# 3. Piece Types and the Ball

In "xfutebol," each piece on the board represents a player type found in a soccer game, and each has unique abilities and roles. Understanding these is key to mastering the game.

## Piece Types

### Attacker
- **Movement**: Attackers can move 2 squares forward, 1 backward, and 1 to the sides.
- **Special Ability**: They can sprint up to 4 squares in the direction of the opponent's goal area.

### Defender
- **Movement**: Defenders move 1 square forward, 1 to the sides, and 2 squares backward.
- **Role**: Primarily focused on defensive strategies and intercepting the opponent's plays.

### Midfielder

Understanding the strengths and limitations of each piece type, along with effective ball control, forms the basis of successful gameplay in "xfutebol."


## The Goaler Promotion and Added Skills
(move to the rule book)
When a piece successfully scores a goal in "xfutebol," it is promoted to a Goaler, gaining enhanced abilities that make it more versatile and impactful on the board.

### Enhanced Movement
- **Additional Step**: A Goaler receives a +1 movement bonus to its weakest direction, enhancing its mobility and strategic value. This additional step allows the piece to cover more ground and adapt to different game situations more effectively.
- **Examples**:
  - A Defender, which by default moves 1 step forward, 1 to the sides, and 2 backward, can move 2 steps to the sides as a Goaler.
  - A Midfielder, originally moving 2 steps to the sides, 1 forward, and 1 backward, gains the ability to move 2 steps forward.
  - An Attacker, with a default movement of 2 steps forward, 1 backward, and 1 to the sides, can move 2 steps to the sides.

### Enhanced Abilities
- **Sprinting**: All Goalers, regardless of their original piece type, gain the ability to Sprint. This ability is particularly impactful for pieces like Defenders and Midfielders, who originally have more limited forward movement.
- **Offensive and Defensive Flexibility**: The promotion to a Goaler enhances a piece's capabilities in both offensive and defensive plays, making it a more formidable presence on the board.

The Goaler promotion is a key strategic element in "xfutebol." It rewards successful offensive plays with enhanced capabilities, encouraging players to pursue goal-scoring opportunities and effectively utilize their promoted pieces in various phases of the game.
