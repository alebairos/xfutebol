# 2. The Board

"xfutebol" is played on a board that skillfully merges the strategic layout of a chessboard with the thematic elements of a soccer field.

## Board Layout
- **Size and Grid**: The game utilizes an 8x8 grid, akin to a standard chessboard, with each square representing a segment of the soccer field.
- **Design**: The board features design elements of a soccer field, such as midfield lines and goal areas, within the functional framework of a chessboard.

## Special Areas
### Penalty Areas
- These are located at each end of the board, mirroring the penalty zones on a soccer field. The penalty areas extend from B1 to G1 and B2 to G2 for one player, and the symmetrically opposite rectangles for the other player.
- Specific rules apply when pieces and the ball are within these zones, echoing the critical nature of penalty areas in soccer.

### Goal Tiles
- Situated within the penalty areas, these tiles represent the goals. They consist of C1, D1, E1, F1 for one player, and their symmetric counterparts for the opposing player.
- Scoring is achieved by moving the ball into these tiles under designated gameplay conditions.
- **Exclusive to Goalkeepers**: Only Goalkeepers are allowed to be positioned on the goal tiles. Other pieces can enter a goal tile only when moving with the ball to score a goal.
- **Scoring**: A goal is scored when a piece successfully moves the ball onto one of these tiles.

### Midfield Line
- This line bisects the board, dividing it into two halves, setting the starting territories for each player.

# 3. Piece Types and the Ball

In "xfutebol," each piece on the board represents a player type found in a soccer game, and each has unique abilities and roles. Understanding these is key to mastering the game.

## Piece Types

### Attacker
- **Movement**: Attackers can move 2 squares forward, 1 backward, and 1 to the sides.
- **Special Ability**: They can sprint up to 4 squares in the direction of the opponent's goal area.

### Defender
- **Movement**: Defenders move 1 square forward, 1 to the sides, and 2 squares backward.
- **Role**: Primarily focused on defensive strategies and intercepting the opponent's plays.

### Midfielder
- **Movement**: Midfielders can move 2 squares to the sides, 1 forward, and 1 backward.
- **Special Ability**: Capable of executing uninterceptable long passes, crucial for setting up attacks.

### Goalkeeper
- **Movement**: The Goalkeeper can move 1 square in any direction.
- **Role**: Vital for defending the goal area, with exclusive rights to intercept within the goal tiles.

## The Ball
- **Central to Gameplay**: The ball is moved across the board via various actions like passes and shots.
- **Scoring**: A goal is scored when the ball is successfully moved into the opponent's goal tiles.

# 4. The Rule Book

## General Rules

"xfutebol" is designed with a set of general rules that govern the flow of the game, ensuring a balance between strategic planning and dynamic action.

### Turn Structure
- **Two Movements per Turn**: Each player is allowed two movements during their turn. This structure encourages tactical decision-making and diverse gameplay strategies.
- **Mandatory MOVE Action**: Out of the two movements, at least one must be a MOVE action. This rule is crucial to maintain the game's balance and to prevent repetitive and unchallenged plays, such as continuous uninterceptable long passes between Midfielders.

### Movement and Action Limitations
- **Diverse Actions**: Besides the mandatory MOVE action, players can choose from various actions like PASS, SHOOT, DRIBBLE, or SPRINT for their second movement. This variety allows for creative and unexpected plays.
- **Restriction on Repetitive Actions**: To prevent the domination of a single type of play (like repeated long passes), the game limits certain actions when used consecutively or excessively by the same piece type.

### Interception Mechanics
- **Interception Limit**: To maintain a dynamic and fluid game, interceptions are limited to a maximum of five per turn. Exceeding this limit results in a special foul, giving the defensive side a chance to reset the play.
- **Strategic Interception**: Interceptions require strategic positioning. A piece cannot intercept the ball or another piece if the movement is coming from behind it.

These general rules lay the foundation for "xfutebol," combining strategic depth with fast-paced action. Players are encouraged to think creatively within this framework to outmaneuver their opponents and score goals.

# 4.1 Piece Movements

The movement abilities in "xfutebol" are tailored to each piece type, reflecting their roles on a soccer field. Mastery of these movements is crucial for strategic gameplay.

## Attacker
- **Forward Movement**: Moves up to 2 squares forward.
- **Lateral and Backward Movement**: Can move 1 square to the sides and 1 square backward.

## Defender
- **Backward Movement**: Specializes in moving up to 2 squares backward.
- **Forward and Lateral Movement**: Moves 1 square forward and 1 square to the sides.

## Midfielder
- **Side Movement**: Can move 2 squares to the sides.
- **Forward and Backward Movement**: Moves 1 square forward and 1 square backward.
- **Pass Restriction**: Uninterceptable long passes are not effective within the penalty area (B1 to G1 and B2 to G2).

## Goalkeeper
- **Omni-Directional Movement**: Moves 1 square in any direction, focusing on goal defense.

## Sprinting
- **Attackers and Goalers**: Have the ability to Sprint, covering up to 4 squares towards the opponent's goal.

## Updated Interception Rule
- **Interception Restriction**: A piece cannot intercept if the movement is coming from behind it.

# 4.2 Piece Actions

In "xfutebol," specific actions are associated with each piece, playing a pivotal role in the strategy and tactics of the game.

#### Passing
- **All Pieces**: Every piece can execute a PASS action. The pass range is determined by the piece's movement abilities.
- **Midfielder's Long Pass**: 
  - Midfielders are skilled at executing long passes, extending up to double their lateral movement range.
  - **Restriction**: This uninterceptable pass ability is not effective within the penalty area (tiles B1 to G1 and B2 to G2). 
  - **Interception**: Outside the penalty area, these passes cannot be intercepted by adjacent opponent pieces. However, within the penalty area, the pass can be intercepted by adjacent pieces, making the long pass more challenging and strategic near the goal.

#### Shooting
- **All Pieces**: Pieces can attempt to SHOOT towards the goal. The shot's success depends on the distance, the shooter's abilities, and the goalkeeper's position and skills.
- **Special Areas**: Shots taken from special areas, such as the penalty zone, may be subject to additional rules and considerations.

#### Passing and Shooting
- **Ball Movement**: The ball cannot cross a tile occupied by a piece. If the ball encounters an opponent's piece, an interception occurs. If it encounters a piece from the same team, a completed pass occurs.
- **Implications**: This rule adds strategic depth to passing and shooting, requiring players to consider the positioning of all pieces on the board.

#### Sprinting
- **Attackers and Goalers**: These pieces have the ability to SPRINT, covering up to 4 squares in a direct line towards the opponent's goal. Sprinting is vital for creating offensive opportunities or for quick defensive positioning.

#### Interceptions
- **Defensive Strategy**: Pieces can intercept the ball by moving to a tile with an opponent's piece holding the ball, except if the movement is from behind the intercepting piece.
- **Goalkeepers' Role**: Goalkeepers have exclusive rights to intercept within their goal tiles, emphasizing their defensive importance.

# 4.3 The Goaler Promotion and Added Skills

In "xfutebol," scoring a goal is not only a pivotal moment in the game but also triggers a significant transformation for the piece that scored. This transformation is known as the Goaler promotion, which bestows enhanced abilities on the piece.

## Promotion to Goaler
- **Achieving the Title**: A piece is promoted to a Goaler immediately after it successfully scores a goal.
- **Permanent Change**: This promotion is permanent for the duration of the game, signifying the piece's elevated status and importance on the board.

## Enhanced Movement
- **Increased Mobility**: A Goaler receives a +1 movement bonus to its weakest direction, thereby increasing its effectiveness and versatility.
   - **Defender as Goaler**: A Defender, usually moving 1 step forward and to the sides and 2 steps backward, can move 2 steps to the sides post-promotion.
   - **Midfielder as Goaler**: A Midfielder, typically moving 2 steps to the sides, 1 forward, and 1 backward, gains the ability to move 2 steps forward.
   - **Attacker as Goaler**: An Attacker, with default movements of 2 steps forward, 1 backward, and 1 to the sides, can move 2 steps to the sides.

## Enhanced Abilities
- **Sprinting Capability**: All pieces promoted to Goalers, regardless of their original type, gain the ability to Sprint. This ability is particularly impactful for pieces like Defenders and Midfielders, enhancing their offensive potential.
- **Strategic Advantage**: The promotion to a Goaler adds a layer of strategic depth to the game. Players must consider how to utilize their enhanced pieces effectively, both in offense and defense.

The Goaler promotion in "xfutebol" is a key element that adds excitement and strategic complexity to the game. It rewards goal-scoring with a tangible in-game advantage, encouraging players to pursue offensive opportunities and thoughtfully utilize their promoted pieces.
